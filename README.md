<!-- PROJECT ORIGINS -->

## Project Origins

Water-Ways was created due to a desire for more efficient boat tours and boat travel. I live in a community right along a beautiful lake. My community has many different restaurants and places around the lake. Getting around by boat is the most efficient, and most scenic way to travel within the community. While our community does offer a boat taxi, it is a very inefficient system that requires you to book 24 hours in advance. This is a very dated system. My goal is to create a system that allows the many boat owners to make a little extra money, while creating a much more efficient system for tours and taxis.

<!-- A WORD ON AUTHENTICATION -->

## User Stories

**Account Management**: As a user, I want to be able to create an account and update my profile, so that I can personalize my experience and manage my information securely. As this is unique to Towne Lake, a user must provide Towne Lake address information in order to create an account.

**Being a Driver**: A user should be able to register as a driver, which has a different authorization to a normal user. In order to be a driver, one must be able to provide their boating license, and Towne Lake ID.

**Booking a Ride**: As a rider, I want to be able to easily book a ride by inputting the address I'd like to be picked up at, as well as the address of my destination

**Pickup and Drop-off**: As a user, I should be able to clearly be directed to the closest dock to my entered pickup address for my ride

**Scheduling a Ride**: As this is a small app unique to the community of Towne Lake, wait times might be higher than desired. As a user, I should be able to book a ride in advanced, and if wait times are higher than normal during your desired ride, a user should be given the option to book in advanced as an alternative option.

**Payment**: As a user, I should be able to pay through the app and receive payment (as a driver) through the app.
